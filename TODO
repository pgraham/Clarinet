- Support migrating a right side entity in a one-to-many relationship to a new left side entity.
- Support cache updates for mirrored many-to-many relationships.
- Support deep save or mirrored many-to-many relationships.  The problem is that
  if the many-to-many relationship forms a complete graph then the deep update()
  calls will result in an infinite loop.  One possible approach for solving this
  would be for each persister to maintain a cache of which entities are
  currently involved in an update operation, and have the update method simply
  return if it is called for an entity that is already being updated.
