- Support migrating a right side entity in a one-to-many relationship to a new
  left side entity.
- Support cache updates for mirrored many-to-many relationships.

  mean creating a PropertyBuilder class that generates custom code for boolean
  properties.
 
- Add support for one-to-one relationships

- Move Model structure representation classes (contained in model package) into
  Reed
